We are working together doing pair programming.
All of work submited here is code written by us,
except for code copied from the instructor's directories.

We both have read and understood the UC Santa Cruz
Academic Misconduct Policy for Undergraduates.
https://ue.ucsc.edu/academic-misconduct.html

We acknowledge that each partner in a progrmaming pair is 
responsible for the work performed by the other partner,
and all work has been reviewed by both partners working
together. Both of us know the format of the PARTNER file.
